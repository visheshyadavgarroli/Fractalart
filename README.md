# Fractalart
  Lorenz Attractor – Fractal Art Project
  About Fractal Art

Fractal Art is a form of digital art created using mathematical equations and repeated calculations (iterations).
Fractals are patterns that:

Show self-similarity (small parts look like the whole structure)

Contain infinite detail

Are generated using mathematical rules

Appear complex but are based on simple equations

Fractal patterns are commonly found in nature such as clouds, tree branches, snowflakes, rivers, and coastlines.

Fractal Art combines:

Mathematics

Computer Programming

Visualization

Creativity

  About This Project

This project visualizes the Lorenz System, a mathematical model from Chaos Theory that produces a butterfly-shaped structure called the Lorenz Attractor.

The system was originally developed for weather prediction research and demonstrates the concept of the Butterfly Effect, where small changes in initial conditions lead to drastically different outcomes.

In this project:

The Lorenz equations are numerically simulated.

Thousands of iterations generate 3D trajectory points.

Multiple starting conditions are used to demonstrate chaotic behavior.

The motion is visualized as a glowing animated fractal structure.

The result is a dynamic 3D fractal artwork that shows how deterministic mathematical equations can create unpredictable yet structured patterns.
